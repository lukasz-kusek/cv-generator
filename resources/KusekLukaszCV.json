He very quickly picked up the new technology stack of our team (Scala and Akka) and he became a master of them. He is a highly creative and innovative individual, who has contributed many great architectural designs to our projects. Łukasz is extremely hard working who consistently delivers high quality work products, keen to produce clean code and meanwhile meets or exceeds deadlines. I would recommend him to anybody."

Since the first day I had a high feeling of collaboration: I always remember the series of discussions we had about various aspects of the software. His impact on the team was very important, not only for the technical point of view, but also he managed to influence the way we were working. As result, in few weeks we reached and higher quality bar and we produced great software. I recommend Łukasz as colleague for his vast technical skills but also because he is a great person to work with."
